# AGILE 2025 Workshop: LLMs for Conversational Geodata Search

This is the official repository for the **AGILE 2025 Workshop on Large Language Models (LLMs) for Geodata Search**, held on **June 10, 2025**, in **Dresden, Germany**, as part of the [AGILE Conference 2025](https://agile-gi.eu/conference-2025).

## üß≠ Workshop Overview
This repository contains materials for the AGILE 2025 half-day workshop titled "Large Language Models for Conversational Geodata Search." The workshop explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance search capabilities over geospatial data repositories.

Traditional search systems often fall short in handling complex, natural language queries in the geoinformatics domain. This workshop introduces participants to conversational interfaces powered by LLMs, demonstrating how they can be used to improve dataset findability, usability, and search experience.

## üéØ Workshop Topics & Objectives
### Topics Covered
- GeoAI and LLM integration
- Conversational interfaces for spatial data discovery
- Deterministic and agent-based approaches
- Spatio-temporal querying using LLMs

### Learning Objectives
By the end of the workshop, participants will:
- Understand the application of LLMs for search tasks involving geographic datasets
- Learn how to formulate and evaluate prompts for spatio-temporal queries
- Gain hands-on experience through Jupyter notebooks and prompt testing

‚úÖ Planned Outcomes
- Interactive experimentation with LLMs and spatial queries
- Collaborative prompt testing and refinement
- Shared educational resources: slides, notebooks, and prompt examples
- Published materials as open educational resources (OER) for the GIScience community
